# LHDev

🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS** 🚧

This repository contains the source code for my **portfolio website**, showcasing my coding and development projects. The site features an interactive **Three.js** desk scene where users can zoom in and out as if sitting or standing. The desk includes an old IBM-style computer with a **Windows 95-style interface**, where desktop icons serve as hyperlinks to separate projects.
